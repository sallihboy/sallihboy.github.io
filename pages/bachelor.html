					<h2>My Bachelor Thesis:</h2>
					<h1>Development of a configurable audio effects device with RNBO</h1>
					<p>This thesis deals with the development of a hardware audio effect device. The goal of this device is to try out self-developed audio effects with the least amount of effort using a haptic device. Based on a Raspberry Pi single board computer and self-designed printed circuit boards, a functional prototype was created. In addition, research on common effect algorithms, such as echoes and filters, was done in this work. Based on these algorithms, a custom effect was built and this was tested with the created device. Finally, tests were performed on the functionalities of the device. The whole project was realized mostly using the software Max and its software extension RNBO.
